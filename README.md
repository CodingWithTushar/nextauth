This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This repository demonstrates robust authentication solutions in Next.js using useSession, server-side authentication, and NextAuth. Key topics covered include:

useSession Hook: Managing user sessions with ease in client-side and server-side contexts.
Server-Side Authentication: Ensuring secure handling of user authentication on the server.
NextAuth Integration: Setting up and configuring NextAuth for a seamless authentication experience.
Credential Providers: Implementing custom authentication flows using Credential Providers in NextAuth.
Dynamic Module Integration: Modularizing authentication logic for flexibility and reusability.
Features
Secure login and session management.
Modular and scalable authentication setup.
Examples of both client-side and server-side authentication flows.
Tech Stack
Next.js
NextAuth
React
Explore the code to understand how to build a secure and modular authentication system in a modern web application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
